## Things to work on
Contributions are welcome. :)

### Short-term
(will likely do)
- [ ] Open Issues (see Github issue tracking and Reddit post)
- [ ] Localization support
- [ ] More information on cameras (screen shot? coverage angles? video?)

### Medium-term
(might do)
- New Map Elements:
   - [ ] Helpful screen shots
   - [ ] Helpful tips/notes   
- CI, Build & Deploy Improvements:
   - [ ] scss linting
   - [ ] Automated site deployments from master
   - [ ] Some unit and/or integration and/or perceptual diff tests
   - [ ] Improve distribution size (min, gzip, etc)
   - [ ] scss -> css part of deploy (no longer check in processed css)

### Long-term
(probably out of scope)
- [ ] Split grid view (multiple levels at once in sync, maybe x4 layout?)
- [ ] Game monitoring integration (show you where you are on map in real-time)
- [ ] Socket.io for one person control - pinging?
