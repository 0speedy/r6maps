## Things to work on
Contributions are welcome. :)

### Short-term
(will likely do)
- [ ] Open Issues (see Github issue tracking and Reddit post)
- [ ] German localization, maybe Portuguese Brazil
- [ ] Better initial home view, grid selection

### Medium-term
(might do)
- [ ] World globe map locations
- [ ] More localization - Spanish, Finish, Russian, etc?
- [ ] Split grid view (multiple levels at once in sync, maybe x4 layout?)
- CI, Build & Deploy Improvements:
   - [ ] scss linting
   - [ ] Automated site deployments from master
   - [ ] Some perceptual diff tests & basic UI tests
   - [ ] Improve distribution size (min, gzip, etc)
   - [ ] scss -> css part of deploy (no longer check in processed css)

### Long-term
(probably out of scope)
- [ ] Socket.io for some kind of collaboration or coach mode?
- [ ] Helpful tips / strats (community contributions, maybe posts?)
