- [ ] Translations for more languages (looking for contributions - example PR: https://github.com/capajon/r6maps/pull/27)
- [ ] 'Camera #s' (indicating camera order)
- [ ] Better payload management (combine and minify js and other assets, version #?)
- [ ] Experiment with progressive web app - ie offline app access?
- [ ] Any new maps as released by Ubisoft

### Medium-term (probably)
- [ ] Initial team session beta (shared change map, basic ping, etc)
- [ ] More team session features (planning by role?)
- CI, Build & Deploy Improvements:
   - [ ] scss linting
   - [ ] Perceptual diff tests & basic UI tests
   - [ ] Improve distribution size (min, gzip, etc) if an issue

### Long-term (maybe)
